<h3> About Carnations</h3> 
<p> According to a Christian legend, Carnations first appeared on earth as Jesus carried the Cross. Carnations sprang up from where the Virgin Mary's tears fell as she cried over her son's plight.
Miss. Anna Jarvis (The Founder of Mother's Day) used Carnations at the first Mother's Day celebration because Carnations were her mother's favorite flower. <br> 
carnations Of the several kinds of Carnations, the three most common are the annual carnations, border carnations and perpetual-flowering carnations. <br> 
Carnations are also commonly referred to by their scientific name, "Dianthus", the name given by the Greek botanist Theopharastus. Carnations got the name Dianthus from two Greek Words - "dios", referring to the god Zeus, and "anthos", meaning flower. Carnations are thus known as the "The Flowers of God". <br> 
The history of the carnation traces back to ancient Greece and Rome. At that point in time, carnations were primarily available in peach and pale pink shades. The color was thought to resemble human flesh and carnation flower meaning took on the idea of the incarnation, God being made flesh. This carnation meaning traces to the Latin root “carnis,” which means flesh. <br> 
Plant breeding efforts have produced a literal rainbow of carnation flower hues, from red, to purple, to green. Each color of carnation flower has a separate, definitive meaning. A pale red denotes admiration and the idea that “my heart aches for you,” while dark red conveys feelings of deep love and affection. <br> 
Pink carnation flower meanings include gratitude and the concept of never forgetting someone. A yellow carnation bloom expresses the idea of rejection and disappointment with someone. White carnations usually carry the thought of purity and sweetness. When given on Mother’s Day, they also are said to bring a mother good luck. <br> 
Some carnation petals are solid hues, while others are striped. Solid blossoms embody the idea of an affirmative answer (yes), while striped carnation flower meaning signifies refusal (no). Purple carnations are said to represent carpriciousness, while green carnations seem to be reserved for St. Patrick’s Day and giving to teachers. <br> 
Carnations are the official state flower of Ohio, as well as the official national flower of Spain. In Korea, children give parents carnations on Parents’ Day, which is a combination of Mother’s and Father’s Days. For the first wedding anniversary, carnations are the traditional gift. This familiar blossom is also the birth flower for the month of January. <br>
